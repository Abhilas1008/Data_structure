    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "To understand why Python insists on using immutable objects for dictionary keys, consider a real-world dictionary.\n",
    "Each word (key) has a definitive spelling (immutable) and leads you to a specific definition (value). Just like in a real \n",
    "dictionary, Python dictionary keys must be steadfast and unchanging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable objects include types like integers, floats, strings, and tuples that contain immutable elements.\n",
    "Once you've defined a key, it remains constant throughout the life of the dictionary. This unchangeability is vital because\n",
    "keys are hashed: they're transformed into integers for rapid access. If you could change a key, it would be like altering a\n",
    "word's spelling after it's been put in a dictionary - chaos would ensue! The mapping would be lost, as the key's hash value \n",
    "would no longer point to the same 'location' in the dictionary.\n",
    "The immutability of keys thus fuels a dictionary's efficiency, particularly when it comes to locating associated values.\n",
    "A common error made by learners is trying to use lists as keys since lists can modify their contents. \n",
